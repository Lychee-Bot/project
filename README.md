# Lychee Bot - Group 36 EE106A Final Project

- Navigating in a dynamic urban environment is hard. 
- Moving around humans is challenging since the motion is non-deterministic and human’s goal is unknown.
- Goal: Research and experiment with methods to infer human motion behavior and navigate around humans. 
- Real-time motion planning around humans: active research area.

## Research Goal

1. Understand how humans interact with static obstacles as well as other humans.
2. Path plan a trajectory from current state state to goal navigating around static and moving obstacles. 
3. Model a human’s trajectory and incorporate its behavior into our path planning algorithm.
4. Create a controller to receive commands from a master algorithm and actuate.
